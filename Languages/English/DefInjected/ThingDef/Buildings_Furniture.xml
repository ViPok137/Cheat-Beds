  <CheatBed_Single.description>An experimental single-occupant rest platform integrating neuromechanical feedback and adaptive bioscanning. The system induces rapid sleep onset via gentle oscillation and synchronized neural signals. During treatment, it performs full-spectrum analysis of the patient and transmits a precise anatomical projection into the surgeon’s visual cortex, reducing error margin to near zero.</CheatBed_Single.description>

  <CheatBed_Double.description>A dual-occupant neuro-somatic recovery unit. Incorporates synchronized rocking mechanisms, cortical resonance induction, and deep bioscanning arrays. When used in medical procedures, the bed overlays a full diagnostic reconstruction into the surgeon’s visual cortex, allowing for unprecedented surgical precision. Supports simultaneous treatment of two patients under identical conditions.</CheatBed_Double.description>
